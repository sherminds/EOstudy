# Get data from the evoldir website (Flo)

type
```
./getlist Month
```
where `Month` is the three letter version of the month (Jan, Fev, ...). 

This (replace `Month` by the 3-letter month)
- creates a `.csv` file `ads_Month.csv` listing all the ads, their date and type (Conferences/WorkshopsCourses).
- downloads all the texts of the ads, stored in a folder `ads/Month/`.
- copies the list of ads in the working directory, to later include it in the file with all data.
- creates `_summary.md` file for each ad, that will be filled in later.

Then synchronize with Github. May need to first
```{sh}
git pull origin master
```
to download the changes in `_summary.md` files done by coworkers. 

# Compile evoldir data

## Tasks

 1) Add the ads in the AllData file on Google Drive (Flo)
   Copy-paste the list generated with the above-mentionned script ad the end of the table.

 2) Fill in the summary file

  In the `_summary.md` file for each ad (in `Evoldir/ads/MON`, where MON is 3-letter month), compile all the names of speakers and organisers that you can find in the evoldir ad and on the ad website (remove *, - and superfluous things to end up with clean lists with one name per line)

 3) Fill in the Data set

   For each ad, fill in the AllData table in Google drive (see below)

## Hesitations

** If you have any hesitation about an entry, please flag it with a bright background color** (e.g., yellow, red, but do not use gray which is reserved for non-included ads).

## Inclusion rule

Set include = FALSE if

 - event is a duplicate (has already been announced and is hence already listed in the AllData table);
 - no information on invited speakers/info at all (neither in ad nor website; happens for instance for "save the date" type of ads);
 - if Course: if run by private company like prstatistics (we want to focus on "academic" events). 

**AND** do put a comment in the Comments column (last one) to justify the decision. 

Note: Do include Courses even if there are only instructors listed. The `Type` column is here to help distinguish between Courses, Workshops and Conferences, and hence the different types of "invited speakers". 

## Organizers

If no single piece of information is found about the organizers (neither SciComm nor Organizers), enter zeros ("0") in the `Org_nb` and `Org_W` columns. We need to always fill in entries for the organizers, otherwise the columns won't appear in the questionnaire and the contact person will not have a chance to enter the information.
