Dear colleagues

This is a reminder that the registration for this year's morphometrics 
course from the University of Manchester is open (deadline: 21 October 
2016).

This year's course will run via the web in the six weeks from 7 November 
to 16 December 2016.

Course content:
*  Data acquisition: the kinds of data and the equipment used to collect 
them.
*  Definitions of size and shape
*  Geometric methods to characterise shape from a configuration of 
landmark points (Procrustes superimposition)
*  Statistics of variation, scatter plots, basic multivariate statistics
*  Principal component analysis
*  Measurement error and outliers
*  Shape transformations and 'warping' -- the thin plate spline
*  Analysis of outline shapes
*  Distinguishing between groups (taxonomy, clinical diagnosis, etc.)
*  Allometry and size correction
*  Influence of external factors on shape (ecomorphology, dose-response 
studies)
*  Symmetric forms and measurement of asymmetry.
*  Morphometric inferences on developmental processes
*  Morphological integration and modularity
*  Genetics of shape: analyses of resemblance between relatives, QTL 
analyses.
*  Phylogeny: examining the history of evolutionary changes of shape

Practice examples:
As far as possible, practical exercises are provided to accompany the 
course content. These practice exercises consist of data sets and 
explanations on how to run the respective analyses using the MorphoJ 
software (http://www.flywings.org.uk/MorphoJ_page.htm).
Participants who already have their own data are encouraged to use those 
and to discuss them as part of the course. I hope there will be a bit of 
a 'workshop' feel to the course unit.

Group work:
Participants will work in small groups to prepare web presentations of 
possible morphometric studies (wikis prepared by the groups). This 
activity stimulates discussion and provides a broad overview of the 
broad range of questions that can be addressed with morphometric methods.

Further information on the course and a link to the registration page 
can be found on the following we site:

Registtration uses the university's e-store, which can process automatic 
*payments by credit card or debit card*. The deadline for registration 
via this site is the *21 October 2016*.

The direct link to the e-store is this:

The fee for the course is GBP 340.00.

If you cannot pay by credit or debit card, or *if you require a formal 
invoice* (e.g. for reimbursement by your institution), you need to 
contact the Short Course Office in our faculty via this E-mail:
FLS-shortcourses@manchester.ac.uk
If you need to use this option, please do so as soon as possible, but 
definitely *well before October*.

Best wishes,
