RECOMB COMPARATIVE GENOMICS 2016, CALL FOR PAPERS

SCOPE
The annual RECOMB Comparative Genomics Satellite Conference (RECOMB-CG) brings 
together leading researchers in the mathematical, computational and life 
sciences to discuss cutting edge research in comparative genomics, with  an 
emphasis on computational approaches and the analysis of novel experimental 
results. The program will include keynote talks, contributed talks, and a 
poster session.

The 14th RECOMB-CG conference will be held in MontrÃ©al, Canada, October 11-14
2016. With this Call for Papers we invite high-quality original full papers on
topics related to the conference theme. The conference will also have a poster 
session. A detailed call for posters will be published later on the conference 
web page.

TOPICS
Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:
- genome evolution
- genome rearrangements
- genome variation, diversity and dynamics
- phylogenomics
- comparative tools for genome assembly
- population genomics
- comparison of functional networks
- comparative epigenomics
- paleogenomics
- cancer evolution genomics
- epidemiology
- gene identification and/or annotation

IMPORTANT DATES
Paper Submission Deadline: June 6, 2016
Author Notification: July 8, 2016
Final Version Due: July 22, 2016
Conference: October 11-14, 2016

DETAILS ON SUBMITTING MANUSCRIPTS
Submitted papers must have not been published or be currently under
consideration for publication in any other journal or conference with formal 
proceedings. All accepted papers will have to be presented by one of the 
authors at the conference.

Accepted papers will be published in one of three journals:
- a special issue of BMC Genomics, edited by a RECOMB-CG PC chair,
- a special issue of BMC Bioinformatics, edited by a RECOMB-CG PC chair,
- a special section of a regular issue of Bioinformatics (Oxford University
  Press), edited by a RECOMB-CG PC chair and a Bioinformatics Associate 
  Editor.

As BMC Genomics and BMC Bioinformatics are Open Access journals, there will be 
an author fee of Â922 (922 Pounds Sterling) for publication in the event that
an article is accepted in one of these two journals.

Papers accepted for presentation at the conference and considered for 
publication in Bioinformatics will be subject to an extra round of reviewing 
to ensure they meet the usual standards of the journal. Papers appearing in 
Bioinformatics will be subject to the regular fees of Bioinformatics for 
extra pages and colour figures for example.

Authors will need to indicate upon submission their preferred publication
option (BMC Genomics, BMC Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics). This preference
should be stated in the Abstract section of the Easychair submission page.
However, the final decision about the journal for each paper will be taken by 
the RECOMB-CG PC chairs and communicated to the authors upon acceptance. 

Papers must be submitted in PDF format according to the guidelines for authors 
of the respective journal:
https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/preparing-your-manuscript
http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/bioinformatics/for_authors/general.html

Papers submitted in BMC format must be within 10 pages, while papers submitted
in Bioinformatics format must be limited to 7 pages. In both cases a clearly 
marked appendix can be added to the submission that contains supplementary 
material made available to the reviewers.

All submissions must be made online, through the EasyChair submission system,
at the following address:
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recombcg2016

Authors need to register on that web site before submitting. A standard PDF 
file must be received by midnight on June 6, 2016 (any time  zone) in order 
for a submission to be considered. Re-submission of already submitted papers 
will be possible until midnight June 8, 2016 (any time zone).
