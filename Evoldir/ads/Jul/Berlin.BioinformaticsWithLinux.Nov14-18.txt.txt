Course: Introduction to Linux and workflows for biologists
>From Monday 14th to Friday 18th November 2016 in Berlin, Germany

Instructor: Dr Martin Jones

Overview
Most high-throughput bioinformatics work these days takes place on
the Linux command line. The programs which do the majority of the
computational heavy lifting   genome assemblers, read mappers,
and annotation tools   are designed to work best when used with a
command-line interface. Because the command line can be an intimidating
environment, many biologists learn the bare minimum needed to get their
analysis tools working. This means that they miss out on the power of
Linux to customize their environment and automate many parts of the
bioinformatics workflow. This course will introduce the Linux command
line environment from scratch and teach students how to make the most
of its tools to achieve a high level of productivity when working with
biological data.

Intended audience
This workshop is aimed at researchers and technical workers with a
background in biology who want to learn to use the Linux operating
system and the command line environment. No previous experience of Linux
is required.

Course Programme

Monday 14th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30

Session 1 - The design of Linux

In the first session we briefly cover the design of Linux: how is it
different from Windows/OSX and how is it best used? We'll then jump
straight onto the command line and learn about the layout of the Linux
filesystem and how to navigate it. We'll describe Linux's file
permission system (which often trips up beginners), how paths work, and
how we actually run programs on the command line. We'll learn a few
tricks for using the command line more efficiently, and how to deal with
programs that are misbehaving. We'll finish this session by looking
at the built in help system and how to read and interpret manual pages.

Session 2 - System management

We'll first look at a few command line tools for monitoring the status
of the system and keeping track of what's happening to processor power,
memory, and disk space. We'll go over the process of installing new
software from the built in repositories (which is easy) and from source
code downloads (which is trickier). We'll also introduce some tools
for benchmarking software (measuring the time/memory requirements of
processing large datasets).

Tuesday 15th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30

Session 3 - Manipulating tabular data

Many data types we want to work with in bioinformatics are stored as
tabular plain text files, and here we learn all about manipulating
tabular data on the command line. We'll start with simple things like
extracting columns, filtering and sorting, searching for text before
moving on to more complex tasks like searching for duplicated values,
summarizing large files, and combining simple tools into long commands.

Session 4 - Constructing pipelines

In this session we will look at the various tools Linux has for
constructing pipelines out of individual commands. Aliases, shell
redirection, pipes, and shell scripting will all be introduced
here. We'll also look at a couple of specific tools to help with
running tools on multiple processors, and for monitoring the progress
of long running tasks.

Wednesday 16th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30

Session 5 - EMBOSS

EMBOSS is a suite of bioinformatics command-line tools explicitly designed
to work in the Linux paradigm. We'll get an overview of the different
sequence data formats that we might expect to work with, and put what we
learned about shell scripting to biological use by building a pipeline
to compare codon usage across two collections of DNA sequences.

Session 6 - Using a Linux server

Often in bioinformatics we'll be working on a Linux server rather than
our own computer typically because we need access to more computing
power, or to specialized tools and datasets. In this session we'll
learn how to connect to a Linux server and how to manage sessions. We'll
also consider the various ways of moving data to and from a server from
your own computer, and finish with a discussion of the considerations
we have to make when working on a shared computer.

Thursday 17th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30

Session 7 - Combining methods

In the next two sessions   i.e. one full day   we'll put everything
we have learned together and implement a workflow for next-gen sequence
analysis. In this first session we'll carry out quality control
on some paired-end Illumina data and map these reads to a reference
genome. We'll then look at various approaches to automating this
pipeline, allowing us to quickly do the same for a second dataset.

Session 8 - Combining methods

The second part of the next-gen workflow is to call variants to identify
SNPs between our two samples and the reference genome. We'll look at
the VCF file format and figure out how to filter SNPs for read coverage
and quality. By counting the number of SNPs between each sample and the
reference we will try to figure out something about the biology of the
two samples. We'll attempt to automate this analysis in various ways
so that we could easily repeat the pipeline for additional samples.

Friday 18th - Classes from 09:30 to 17:30

Session 9 - Customization

Part of the Linux design is that everything can be customized. This can
be intimidating at first but, given that bioinformatics work is often
fairly repetitive, can be used to good effect. Here we'll learn about
environment variables, custom prompts, soft links, and ssh configuration
a collection of tools with modest capabilities, but which together
can make life on the command line much more pleasant. In this last
session there will also be time to continue working on the next-gen
sequencing pipeline.

Session 10
The afternoon of Friday 18th is reserved for finishing off the next-gen
workflow exercise, working on your own datasets, or leaving early
for travel.
