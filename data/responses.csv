i) an exact 50-50% gender ratio in the keynote speakers. That was slightly difficult this year and we experienced many negative returns (3 female declined our offer whereas 1 male declined our offer).

ii) a rough 50-50% gender ratio in the instructors. Initially we had 6 female, 5 male; but recently 2 male instructors canceled their participation.

iii) Initially we were 2 male organisers which bothered us for gender representation issues. So, we invited a female scientist to join us in the organising committee.
